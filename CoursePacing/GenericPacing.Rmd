### Week 1: (Aug 18, 20)

* This week you will sign-up for free accounts on [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com).

* When you register for a free individual GitHub account, request a [student discount](https://education.github.com) to obtain a few private repositories as well as unlimited public repositories.  Please use something similar to **first_name_last_name** as your username when you register with GitHub.  For example, my username on GitHub is *alanarnholt*. If you have a popular name such as John Smith, you may need to provide some other distinquishing characteristic in your username.  Please use the same **username** for your account on Rpubs. 

* Once you have a GitHub account, send an email to arnholtat@appstate.edu with a Subject line of **STT 2810 - GitHub Username** and tell me in the body of your email your first name, last name, and your GitHub username.  I will then manually add you as a team member to the repository in the STT2810-SP15 organization that has your name (**Last_name-First_name**).  This repository will be where you store all of your work for this course.  I will also change your repository to a private repository.

* Become familiar with the Appstate [RStudio server](https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/). You will use your Appstate user name and password to log in to the server.  You must be registered in the class to access the server.

* Read Chapters 1-3 in Passion Driven Statistics (Light Weight) (PDS), and watch all linked videos in PDS.  The PDS text is maintained at [this repository](https://github.com/alanarnholt/PDS-Book).  There is also a copy on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/arnholt/97944) (but it may not be as current as the repository).

Watch the following videos:

* [Creating RStudio projects from Github Repos (5 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxZ8J2rqhEM)    
* [Colaboration and time travel: version control with git, github and RStudio (48 minutes)](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/archives/)      
* [Reproducible Reporting (58 minutes)](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/archives/) 

* Test drive RStudio by following the directions from [Jenny Bryan's STAT 545 course](https://stat545-ubc.github.io/git07_git-github-rstudio.html).

* Select a data set you will work with and update your GitHub repository **README** with your chosen data set.  

* Complete the Medical Record Assignment, and push your excel spreadsheet to your GitHub account. 

#### Optional
* Read chapters 1-2 of [Reproducible Research with R and RStudio](https://github.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Book).
