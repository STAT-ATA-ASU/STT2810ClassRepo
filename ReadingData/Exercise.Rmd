* Create a variable named `HeightIn` that stores the height in inches of the subjects from the AddHealth Wave I data set.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(PDS)
library(dplyr)
AH <- tbl_df(AddHealth) %>% 
  mutate(HeightIn = H1GH59A*12 + H1GH59B) 
summary(AH$HeightIn)
```

It seems there are problems with the data.  A closer inspection of the code book reveals that values 96, 98, and 99 should be coded as `NA`'s.

```{r}
AddHealth$H1GH59A[AddHealth$H1GH59A == 96 | AddHealth$H1GH59A == 98] <- NA
AddHealth$H1GH59B[AddHealth$H1GH59B == 98 | AddHealth$H1GH59B == 99] <- NA
AddHealth <- tbl_df(AddHealth) %>% 
  mutate(HeightIn = H1GH59A*12 + H1GH59B)
summary(AddHealth$HeightIn)
```

```{r warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = AddHealth, aes(x = HeightIn)) + 
  geom_density(fill = "pink") +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "Height in Inches")
```

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
AddHealth$H1GH60[AddHealth$H1GH60 == 996 | AddHealth$H1GH60 ==998 | AddHealth$H1GH60 == 999] <- NA
AddHealth <- AddHealth %>% 
  rename(Weight = H1GH60)
summary(AddHealth$Weight)
ggplot(data = AddHealth, aes(y = Weight, x = HeightIn)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(y = "Weight in Pounds", x = "Height in Inches") + 
  geom_smooth()
```

Create a gender variable named `Gender`.

```{r}
summary(AddHealth$BIO_SEX)
AddHealth$BIO_SEX[AddHealth$BIO_SEX == 6] <- NA
AddHealth$BIO_SEX <- factor(AddHealth$BIO_SEX, labels = c("Male", "Female"))
AddHealth <- dplyr::rename(AddHealth, Gender = BIO_SEX)
xtabs(~Gender, data = AddHealth)
```

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = AddHealth, aes(y = Weight, x = HeightIn, color = Gender)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(y = "Weight in Pounds", x = "Height in Inches") + 
  geom_smooth()
```

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = na.omit(AddHealth[, c("HeightIn", "Weight", "Gender")]), aes(x = HeightIn, color = Gender, fill = Gender)) + 
  geom_density() +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "Height in Inches") + 
  facet_grid(Gender ~ .)
```
