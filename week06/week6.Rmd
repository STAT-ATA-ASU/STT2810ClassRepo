* Read/review pages 26-33 PDS as needed.
* This week you will "Manage your Data" based on your research proposal.
* Submit via [http://www.crowdgrader.org](http://www.crowdgrader.org) the **Data Management Assignment** NLT 5 PM February 20. Directions: Select three _secondary_ categorical variables from the data set you are using.  Recode your data to create factors with appropriate labels.  Create a barplot for each of your factors and write a sentence or two explaining each barplot.  Show all `R` code used to manage your data and used to create your barplots with `R` code chunks in your `*.Rmd` file.  Submit the resulting `*.html` file to crowdgrader.
The direct link for the **Data Management Assignment** is [http://www.crowdgrader.org/crowdgrader/venues/view_venue/804](http://www.crowdgrader.org/crowdgrader/venues/view_venue/804).   
* Push your "Research Proposal" to your private repository NLT 5 PM February 20.  The folder for your research proposal should contain your `*.Rmd`, `*.bib`, and resulting `*.html` files.

I will use the same grading rubric (below) you used in the peer evaluation phase of the research proposals.  I will also check to make sure the document compiles based on the `*.Rmd` and `*.bib` files in your **Research Proposal** folder.  

## Grading Rubric

1. Does the document open without problems?  Is the grammar and punctuation acceptable? Is the title a concise statement of the main topic?  Does the title identify the actual variables under investigation and the relationship between them? 0/1

2.  Does the introduction describe the question the author intends to investigate and how their research relates to other work in the field?  Does the literature review justify the proposed research by identifying a hole in existing scholarship?  Does the introduction build to and conclude with the research questions or study objectives the author proposes to address?  Is the literature review supported with at least five citations? 0/1

3. Is there a **Methods** section which describes how the research was conducted?  The **Methods** section should include a discussion of the _sample_, _measures_, and _procedures_.  Is there an **Implications/Predicted Results** section that discusses real implications linked to possible results? 0/1

A well written paper that convinces you the author can fill a gap in the existing scholarship, has a title that is a concise statement of the main topic and identifies the actual variables under investigation and the relationship between them, has an introduction supported with at least five references, has a Methods section that describes the sample, measures, and procedures, and has a section that discusses real implications linked to possible results should receive a 3.  A submission that satisfies two of the three criteria perfectly or most but not all of the three criteria should receive a 2.  A submission that satisfies only one of the three criteria should receive a 1.  If the submission does not render or the submitter did not submit the correct assignment, they should receive a 0.
