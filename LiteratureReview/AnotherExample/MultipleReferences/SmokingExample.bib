	abstract = {This study evaluated the adolescent tobacco-use trajectories that predict nicotine dependence in early adulthood and when these trajectories start to diverge. As part of a follow-up to a large prevention trial, the present study evaluated 1,017 individuals from early adolescence (age 12) to early adulthood (age 28). Participants were recruited from eight middle schools in Kansas City, Missouri. Students were entering 6th grade or 7th grade at baseline. Smoking was evaluated at baseline, 6 months, at annual follow-ups through high school, and every 18 months thereafter until age 28. The study goals were to determine (a) whether distinct weekly tobacco-use trajectories could be identified between early adolescence and emerging adulthood (ages 12-24); (b) when during development these trajectories diverged; and (c) which trajectories could predict nicotine dependence in early adulthood (ages 26-28). A four-trajectory mixed model (abstainers, low users, late stable users, and early stable users) demonstrated the best fit to the data. Membership in increasingly high-use trajectories placed participants at greater relative risk for becoming nicotine dependent than did membership in lower-use trajectories. General linear models showed greater weekly cigarette consumption for early stable users as early as the first wave of data collection (age 12) and significant differences among all other trajectories by age 15. The findings support the implementation of smoking prevention programs early in middle or junior high school and suggest that adolescents who are already smoking at least two cigarettes per week by age 12 may benefit from additional addiction prevention efforts.},

Data are from a longitudinal cohort of 324 new smokers from grades 6–10 in the Chicago Public Schools, interviewed 5 times at 6-month intervals. Monthly data on DSM-IV symptoms of nicotine dependence were available for 36 months. Growth mixture modeling was applied to the monthly histories to identify trajectories of DSM-IV criteria of nicotine dependence. A four-class solution best fitted the data: no DSM criterion (47.7\%); early onset/chronic course (19.8\%); early onset/remission (17.3\%); late onset (15.2\%). Blunt use prior to cigarette use was associated with the three symptomatic trajectories. Conduct disorder and prior heavy smoking were associated with Class 2 (chronic). Conduct disorder differentiated Class 2 from Class 4 (late onset), while pleasant initial sensitivity to the first tobacco experience was associated with Classes 2 and 3 (remit) and differentiated Class 2 from Class 4. Novelty seeking characterized Class 3. Parental dependence differentiated chronicity (Class 2) from remission (Class 3) among those who developed symptoms early. Being Hispanic reduced membership in Classes 3 and 4, and being male for Class 3. The data highlight the importance of parental nicotine dependence as a risk factor for early and sustained nicotine dependence by the offspring, pleasant initial sensitivity and conduct disorder for early onset of dependence, and blunt use prior to smoking for all trajectories. The factors important for onset of dependence are not necessarily the same as those for sustained course.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Identifying trajectories of cigarette smoking based on usage patterns is important in elucidating the pathway from initiation to nicotine dependence. Various methods have been used to identify different smoking patterns based on either quantity or frequency smoked.
Methods: This paper examines the link between smoking exposure and nicotine dependence symptoms while looking at both daily and less-than-daily smokers in a nationally representative sample.
Results: Our study found a distinct pattern of cigarette smoking among adolescents aged 12–18 years, suggesting a trajectory in which smokers typically progressed through the following steps: smoking less than 1 cigarette on 1–5 days per month; smoking 1–5 cigarettes on 1–5, 6–9, 10–19, 20–29, and 30 days; and then smoking 6–10 cigarettes on 30 days, 11–20 on 30 days, and more than 20 on 30 days. Few smokers deviated from this pattern. A dose–response relationship was observed between this smoking pattern and having any of the four nicotine dependence symptoms and also with the number of reported nicotine dependence symptoms.
Discussion: The relationship we found between smoking exposure and nicotine dependence symptoms is consistent with the homeostasis–sensitization theory: according to which sensitization involves periods in which a person is increasing the number of cigarettes smoked per day and homeostasis occurs when the number of cigarettes smoked per day remains stable. We provide data that can be used in future studies to update and expand the work on trajectories.},

Rates of endorsement for 17 symptoms drawn primarily from the Nicotine Dependence Symptom Scale () were calculated for four levels of nondaily (smoked 1-3, 4-10, 11-20, or 21-29 days in the past 30 days) and daily (smoked 1, 2-5, 6-15, or {\textgreater}15 cigarettes per day in the past 30 days) smoking. Logistic and linear regression analyses with polynomial contrasts controlling for age, gender, length of exposure, and smoking quantity tested trends in symptom endorsement across levels of smoking. Significant linear and quadratic trends indicated that increasing rates of endorsement differed most between the lowest levels of nondaily and daily smoking. Results suggest that, for some, infrequent smoking may not represent benign experimentation. Recognizing early symptoms of nicotine dependence may assist in early identification and intervention of those at risk for heavier smoking in the future. Adolescents can be taught to recognize the early symptoms of nicotine dependence to increase awareness of the rapidity at which these symptoms may appear.},

	abstract = {SummaryObjectives
There is considerable variability in progression from smoking initiation to established smoking. This paper addresses the extent to which different patterns of adolescent smoking, including periods of cessation, predict smoking status in young adults.
Study design
Ten-year, eight-wave prospective cohort study of a state-wide community sample in Victoria, Australia.
Methods
Participants were 1520 students from 44 secondary schools, initially aged 14 to 15 years. Adolescent smoking and quitting patterns were assessed during Waves 1–6 with self-reported frequency of use and a 7-day retrospective diary. The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (ND) was used to assess ND at the age of 24 years (Wave 8).
Results
The prevalence of ND in young adults was 16.9\% for all adolescent smokers, with prevalence rates of 6.8\% and 26.7\% for adolescent non-daily and daily adolescent smokers, respectively. Maximum smoking levels, onset of daily smoking, duration of smoking, escalation time and duration of cessation during adolescence predicted later ND. Daily smokers who ceased smoking for at least two waves (≥12 months) had a level of risk similar to adolescents who had never smoked.
Conclusions
Quitting smoking as an adolescent substantially alters the risk for later ND. For adolescents who become daily smokers, quitting for 12 months should be the aim in tobacco control and clinical interventions.},

Data are aggregated from three surveys (1991–1993) of the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. A proxy measure of DSM-IV dependence criteria was developed from self-reported symptoms of dependence and drug-related problems. Both frequency and quantity of marijuana use within the last year are linearly associated with the logit of the probability of being dependent on marijuana. The associations vary significantly by age but not gender. Adolescents are dependent at a lower frequency and quantity of use than adults: the differences diverge as level of use increases. Twice as many adolescents as adults who used marijuana near-daily or daily within the last year were identified as being dependent (35\% versus 18\%). Frequency and quantity of use each retained a unique effect on dependence, but frequency appeared to be more important than quantity in predicting last year dependence. These results provide insight into the processes underlying the age and sex differentials observed in the prevalence of marijuana dependence. The implications of the findings for the epidemiology of marijuana use and dependence are discussed.},

	abstract = {Aims
This study was undertaken to evaluate the association between cigarette smoking behavior and DSM-IV nicotine dependence.
Design
Drawing on a sample of first year college students selected for representation across a continuum of smoking behavior, current DSM-IV nicotine dependence criteria were assessed among participants reporting any smoking in the preceding week on a web-based survey protocol. Logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic analyses were used to estimate the overall concordance between smoking and DSM-IV nicotine dependence.
Findings
Relationships were supported between both quantity and frequency of smoking in the past week and DSM-IV nicotine dependence showing higher prevalence of dependence at higher levels of use (p \&lt; 0.05). While the highest prevalence of nicotine dependence was seen among those reporting the most frequent and heavy smoking, a substantial number of participants reporting daily and/or heavy smoking did not meet criteria for nicotine dependence. Conversely, nicotine dependence was seen among a subgroup of participants reporting relatively low levels of non-daily smoking. Diagnostic concordance was found to be moderate for both quantity and frequency and was not improved by combining information from these two indices.
Conclusions
Aside from confirming DSM-IV nicotine dependence at relatively low levels of smoking, these results may be used to inform research aimed at identifying samples of nicotine dependent youth across the range of smoking levels.},

	doi = {10.1007/s12160-008-9051-x},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estimating the timing and speed among smoking milestones is an important challenge for epidemiology given that further reductions in smoking prevalence may be best achieved by programs that target potentially malleable smoking behavior before the development of nicotine dependence.
PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to investigate the association between the timing and speed of transition among major smoking milestones (onset, weekly, and daily smoking) and onset and recovery from nicotine dependence.
METHODS: Analyses are based on data from The National Comorbidity Survey-Replication, a nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted between February 2001 and April 2003.
RESULTS: Of those who had ever smoked (n = 5,692), 71.3\% had reached weekly smoking levels and 67.5\% had reached daily smoking. Four in ten who had ever smoked met criteria for nicotine dependence. A shorter time since the onset of weekly and daily smoking was associated with a transition to both daily smoking and nicotine dependence, respectively. The risk for each smoking transition was highest within the year following the onset of the preceding milestone. Recovery was associated with a longer period of time between smoking initiation and the development of dependence and a later age of smoking onset.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings shed light on the clinical course of smoking and nicotine dependence. Given the importance of timing of smoking transitions, prevalence may be further reduced through intervention targeted at adolescents and young adults in the months most proximal to smoking initiation.},
