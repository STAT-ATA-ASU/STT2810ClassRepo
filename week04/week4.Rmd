A well written paper that convinces you the author can fill a gap in the existing scholarship, has a title that is a concise statement of the main topic and identifies the actual variables under investigation and the relationship between them, has an introduction supported with at least five references, has a Methods section that describes the sample, measures, and procedures, and has a section that discusses real implications linked to possible results should receive a 3.  A submission that satisfies two of the three criteria perfectly or most but not all of the three criteria should receive a 2.  A submission that satisfies only one of the three criteria should receive a 1.  If the submission does not render or the submitter did not submit the correct assignment, they should receive a 0.
